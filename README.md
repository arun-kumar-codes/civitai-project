## About the Project

Our goal with this project is to create a platform where people can share their stable diffusion models (textual inversions, hypernetworks, aesthetic
gradients, VAEs, and any other crazy stuff people do to customize their AI generations), collaborate with others to improve them, and learn from each
other's work. The platform allows users to create an account, upload their models, and browse models that have been shared by others. Users can also
leave comments and feedback on each other's models to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### Tech Stack

We've built this project using a combination of modern web technologies, including Next.js for the frontend, TRPC for the API, and Prisma + Postgres
for the database. By leveraging these tools, we've been able to create a scalable and maintainable platform that is both user-friendly and powerful.
